🩸 Project HOPE — Pads for Dignity
Transparent, Crypto-Powered Fundraiser for Restoring Dignity and Education
Project HOPE is a fully on-chain, transparent humanitarian campaign dedicated to ending period poverty among Ethiopian schoolgirls.
 Our mission is simple yet deeply impactful:
💜 “$10 gives a girl 3–5 years of uninterrupted education and dignity.”

🌍 The Problem
In Ethiopia, over 3 million schoolgirls miss up to 63 days of school every year because they lack access to safe menstrual products.
 Behind every statistic is a human story — a girl forced to skip school, hide her shame, or drop out entirely due to a natural biological process.
 Period poverty isn’t just about hygiene — it’s about education, dignity, and gender equality.

💡 Our Solution
Project HOPE provides high-quality reusable pad kits that last for 3–5 years, each containing:
4 reusable sanitary pads


1 washable pouch


1 bar of soap + drying string


Hygiene & awareness booklet


Each kit is delivered in collaboration with verified local partners, ensuring long-term sustainability and education.
 All donations are crypto-powered and 100% transparent via blockchain verification.

📊 Verified Impact
Using verified data from similar interventions across Africa, Project HOPE’s reusable kits reduce school absenteeism by an estimated 70% —
 from 35% down to just 10%, transforming education and futures.
This isn’t charity — it’s a scalable investment in dignity and opportunity.
